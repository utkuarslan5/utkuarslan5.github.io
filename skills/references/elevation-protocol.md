# Elevation Protocol

A systematic process for taking functional work to polished. Run this internally before delivery.

## The Elevation Mindset

**Draft mentality**: "Does it work? Does it have the content? Ship it."

**Elevation mentality**: "Would a design director approve this? What would they change?"

The goal is not perfection—it's intentionality. Every element should reflect a decision, not a default.

---

## Phase 1: Structure Audit (30 seconds)

### Step Back
Literally zoom out. View the whole artifact at 50% size or arm's length.

### Ask:
1. Is there a clear visual hierarchy?
2. Does the eye know where to go first, second, third?
3. Is there a consistent grid or alignment structure?
4. Does it feel organized or chaotic?

### Common Fixes:
- Increase size contrast between hierarchy levels
- Align elements to a common grid
- Group related items, separate unrelated
- Establish one clear focal point

## Phase 2: Typography Pass (60 seconds)

### Font Audit
1. Are there more than 2-3 font families? (Usually too many)
2. Are these defaults or intentional choices?
3. Do the fonts match the tone of the content?

### Hierarchy Check
1. How many text sizes are there? (More than 5-6 = probably too many)
2. Is there at least 1.5x ratio between levels?
3. Is weight being used to create hierarchy, not just size?

### Refinement
1. Adjust headline tracking (usually tighten -0.01 to -0.03em)
2. Adjust body line-height (usually 1.5-1.7)
3. Check line lengths (45-75 characters ideal)
4. Fix orphans and widows
5. Ensure proper typographic quotes and dashes

---

## Phase 3: Color Pass (45 seconds)

### Palette Audit
1. How many colors are present?
2. Is there a clear primary, secondary, accent?
3. Do the colors have a relationship (same hue family, complementary, etc.)?

### Contrast Check
1. Is body text easily readable?
2. Are interactive elements clearly distinguished?
3. Do accent colors actually stand out?

### Refinement
1. Reduce palette if more than 4-5 colors
2. Adjust tints/shades for consistency
3. Check contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text)
4. Ensure meaning isn't conveyed by color alone

---

## Phase 4: Spacing Pass (45 seconds)

### Consistency Audit
1. Are similar elements spaced identically?
2. Does spacing follow a scale (8, 16, 24, 32...)?
3. Is there enough breathing room?

### Relationship Check
1. Is spacing creating the right groupings?
2. Are related elements closer than unrelated?
3. Is there enough contrast in spacing to create hierarchy?

### Refinement
1. Normalize all spacing to a base unit system
2. Double padding/margins that feel cramped
3. Ensure section separations are clearly larger than internal spacing
4. Check edge spacing (often needs to be larger than internal)

---

## Phase 5: Detail Pass (60 seconds)

### Visual Consistency
1. Are corner radii consistent throughout?
2. Are shadows using the same intensity/spread?
3. Are borders uniform in color and weight?
4. Are icons from the same family and weight?

### Edge Cases
1. What happens with long text?
2. Are there any awkward wrapping or truncation?
3. Do empty states exist and look intentional?

### Polish Details
1. Add subtle shadows to lift important elements
2. Check image quality and sizing
3. Ensure buttons and interactive elements feel clickable
4. Verify alignment of elements within containers

---

## Phase 6: The Fresh Eyes Test (30 seconds)

### Reset
Look away for 10 seconds. Look back.

### Ask
1. What do you notice first? Is that correct?
2. What feels off but you can't articulate why?
3. What's the weakest element?
4. If you had 2 more minutes, what would you fix?

### Make one more refinement
Pick the most impactful fix and do it.

## Elevation Patterns by Output Type

### Presentations
**Common issues**: Too much text, weak hierarchy, inconsistent styling

**Elevation priorities**:
1. One idea per slide
2. Maximum visual hierarchy (huge headlines)
3. Consistent template across all slides
4. Strong opening and closing slides

### Dashboards
**Common issues**: Data overload, unclear hierarchy, no focal point

**Elevation priorities**:
1. Clear primary metric
2. Logical grouping of related data
3. Consistent chart styling
4. Whitespace between sections

### Reports/Documents
**Common issues**: Wall of text, weak structure, inconsistent formatting

**Elevation priorities**:
1. Clear document hierarchy (sections, subsections)
2. Pull quotes or callouts for key points
3. Generous margins and spacing
4. Typography that aids scanability

### HTML/React Artifacts
**Common issues**: Generic styling, inconsistent spacing, weak interactivity

**Elevation priorities**:
1. Custom color palette
2. Intentional typography
3. Consistent component styling
4. Smooth transitions/animations

### Spreadsheets
**Common issues**: Default styling, poor readability, no visual hierarchy

**Elevation priorities**:
1. Header styling that creates hierarchy
2. Consistent number formatting
3. Alternating row colors or borders
4. Frozen headers for navigation

## The 80/20 Elevation Moves

These fixes address 80% of quality issues with 20% of effort:

1. **Increase whitespace** — Almost everything benefits from more breathing room
2. **Reduce colors** — Fewer colors, used more consistently
3. **Pick one great font** — Rather than two mediocre ones
4. **Create one hero** — Every screen needs a clear focal point
5. **Align everything** — Use a grid, align to it ruthlessly
6. **Double-check hierarchy** — Can you tell what's most important instantly?
7. **Fix the details** — Consistent radii, shadows, spacing
8. **Remove decoration** — If it doesn't serve communication, remove it

## Before/After Self-Evaluation

After elevation, compare:

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Hierarchy | Multiple equal elements | Clear primary focus |
| Typography | Defaults | Intentional choices |
| Color | Random or too many | Systematic palette |
| Spacing | Inconsistent | Follows a scale |
| Details | Rough edges | Polished throughout |
| Impression | "Functional" | "Designed" |

If you can't articulate specific improvements in each row, the elevation isn't complete.
