# Design Interrogation Checklist

Run through these questions before delivering ANY visual output. Be ruthless.

## The Big Picture

### Purpose
- [ ] Can someone understand the main point in 3 seconds?
- [ ] Is there a clear visual hierarchy that guides attention?
- [ ] Does every element earn its place, or is there decoration for decoration's sake?

### Audience
- [ ] Does the formality level match the context?
- [ ] Would this feel appropriate in the environment where it'll be seen?
- [ ] Is it accessible to the full range of people who might view it?

### Memorability
- [ ] What's the ONE thing someone will remember?
- [ ] Is there a "hero moment" — something that makes this feel crafted?
- [ ] Would this stand out next to similar artifacts, or blend in?

## Typography Interrogation

### Font Selection
- [ ] Are these fonts intentional choices or lazy defaults?
- [ ] Does the display font have character appropriate to the content?
- [ ] Does the body font read well at the sizes being used?
- [ ] Do the fonts pair well, or fight each other?

### Hierarchy
- [ ] Can you identify H1, H2, body, and secondary text at a glance?
- [ ] Is size the ONLY differentiator, or are weight/color/spacing also working?
- [ ] Are there too many levels of hierarchy (confusing) or too few (flat)?

### Refinement
- [ ] Line heights: Too tight (cramped) or too loose (disconnected)?
- [ ] Letter-spacing: Are headlines tracked appropriately? Is body text left alone?
- [ ] Line lengths: Are paragraphs too wide (exhausting) or too narrow (choppy)?
- [ ] Orphans/widows: Any single words stranded on their own line?

## Color Interrogation

### Palette Logic
- [ ] Is there a clear color system, or random colors throughout?
- [ ] What's the dominant color? Is it intentional?
- [ ] Are accent colors rare enough to actually draw attention?

### Functional Color
- [ ] Does color communicate meaning (success/error/warning)?
- [ ] Are interactive elements clearly distinguished?
- [ ] Is color the ONLY indicator, or do shape/icon also support?

### Contrast & Accessibility
- [ ] Is body text easily readable against its background?
- [ ] Would this work for someone with color vision deficiency?
- [ ] Are subtle color differences actually distinguishable?

## Layout Interrogation

### Whitespace
- [ ] Is there breathing room, or is everything crammed together?
- [ ] Are margins and padding consistent and generous?
- [ ] Does whitespace group related items and separate unrelated ones?

### Alignment
- [ ] Is there an invisible grid creating structure?
- [ ] Are elements that SHOULD align actually aligned?
- [ ] Are intentional misalignments clearly intentional?

### Flow
- [ ] Where does the eye land first? Is that correct?
- [ ] Is there a clear path through the content?
- [ ] Do you ever feel lost or unsure where to look next?

### Balance
- [ ] Does the composition feel stable or uncomfortably weighted?
- [ ] Are asymmetrical layouts intentionally dynamic, or accidentally off?
- [ ] Is density consistent, or are there awkward gaps/clusters?

## Detail Interrogation

### Consistency
- [ ] Are similar elements styled identically?
- [ ] Do spacing units follow a consistent scale?
- [ ] Are corner radii, shadows, borders uniform?

### Polish
- [ ] Are images high quality and appropriately sized?
- [ ] Are icons from the same family with consistent weight?
- [ ] Do buttons, inputs, cards feel refined?

### Edge Cases
- [ ] What happens with long text? Does it break gracefully?
- [ ] Are empty states designed, or default?
- [ ] Do loading/transition states exist and feel considered?

## The Gut Check

### Would You Be Proud?
- [ ] Would you put your name on this?
- [ ] If a designer reviewed this, would they find obvious issues?
- [ ] Does this feel like work that was cared about?

### The Squint Test
- [ ] Squint at it — does the structure still read?
- [ ] Are the important things visually prominent?
- [ ] Does it feel organized or chaotic?

### The Fresh Eyes Test
- [ ] Imagine seeing this for the first time — what would you notice?
- [ ] What would you want to change if you had 5 more minutes?
- [ ] What's the weakest element that's bringing down the whole?

## Red Flags to Catch

Typography red flags:
- System fonts (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif) on styled designs
- Inconsistent sizing that doesn't follow a scale
- Text that's hard to read (size, contrast, or line length)

Color red flags:
- More than 4-5 colors with no clear system
- Neon accents that feel random
- Gray text on gray backgrounds

Layout red flags:
- Everything the same size (no hierarchy)
- Inconsistent spacing (8px here, 17px there)
- Elements floating without alignment relationship

Detail red flags:
- Mixed icon styles (outline + filled, different weights)
- Placeholder content that made it to final
- Rough edges visible at normal viewing distance
