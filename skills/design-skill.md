# Design Mastery

Transform problems into polished, human-centered solutions that look and feel crafted.

## When This Activates

- **Strategy work**: Problem framing, user research, ideation, solution design
- **Visual output**: Presentations, dashboards, HTML, React, reports, spreadsheets, PDFs
- **Any design decision**: When choices need to be intentional, not default

## Phase 1: Understand (Before Creating Anything)

### 1.1 Empathize — Who is this for?

Before touching pixels, answer:

| Question                     | Why It Matters                           |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Who will use/see this?       | Determines tone, complexity, formality   |
| What context are they in?    | Board room? Phone? Late night?           |
| What do they already know?   | Avoid explaining the obvious             |
| What do they need to feel?   | Confident? Excited? Informed?            |
| What's their pain point?     | The real problem to solve                |

**Methods if needed**:

- User interviews / observation
- Empathy mapping
- Persona development
- Journey mapping

### 1.2 Define — What's the actual problem?

Frame the challenge precisely:

> "[User] needs [need] because [insight]"

**Ask**:

- What is this communicating?
- What should be memorable?
- What action should follow?
- What does success look like?

**Output**: A clear problem statement that guides every subsequent decision.

## Phase 2: Create (Generate Solutions)

### 2.1 Ideate — Explore before committing

**Principles**:

- Defer judgment initially
- Quantity enables quality
- Build on ideas
- Encourage wild directions
- Stay visual

**For visual work, commit to a direction**:

| Aesthetic                      | Characteristics                          | When to Use               |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Minimalist precision**       | Swiss design, surgical whitespace        | Data-heavy, corporate     |
| **Editorial sophistication**   | Magazine layouts, dramatic hierarchy     | Narratives, reports       |
| **Dark luxury**                | Deep backgrounds, subtle gradients       | Premium, technical        |
| **Organic warmth**             | Soft shapes, natural palettes            | Consumer, wellness        |
| **Technical authority**        | Data-forward, structured grids           | Dashboards, analytics     |
| **Playful clarity**            | Unexpected color, friendly shapes        | Consumer apps, education  |

**Generic is the enemy.** Pick a lane.

### 2.2 Prototype — Make it real quickly

Start simple, get feedback fast:

| Fidelity     | What                                 | When                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Low**      | Paper sketches, wireframes           | Early exploration      |
| **Medium**   | Digital mockups, rough builds        | Direction validation   |
| **High**     | Interactive demos, polished drafts   | Final validation       |

**Principles**:

- Start simple, iterate
- Focus on key functionality
- Make it testable
- Fail fast and cheap
- Learn through making

## Phase 3: Polish (Elevate Before Delivery)

### 3.1 The Elevation Protocol

Run this internally before delivering ANY visual output:

#### Structure Audit (30 sec)

- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy?
- [ ] Eye knows where to go first, second, third?
- [ ] Consistent grid/alignment?

#### Typography Pass (60 sec)

- [ ] Intentional fonts (not defaults)?
- [ ] Clear hierarchy (H1 → H2 → Body)?
- [ ] Refined spacing (line-height 1.5-1.7 for body)?
- [ ] No orphans/widows?

#### Color Pass (45 sec)

- [ ] Clear palette (max 4-5 colors)?
- [ ] Dominant + accent structure?
- [ ] Sufficient contrast?

#### Spacing Pass (45 sec)

- [ ] Consistent scale (8px base)?
- [ ] Related elements grouped?
- [ ] Breathing room?

#### Detail Pass (60 sec)

- [ ] Consistent radii, shadows, borders?
- [ ] Icons from same family?
- [ ] Edge cases handled?

### 3.2 Quick Wins for Instant Polish

1. **Double the whitespace** you think you need
2. **Reduce to 2-3 colors** maximum
3. **Pick one great font** instead of two mediocre ones
4. **Align everything** to an invisible grid
5. **Add subtle shadows** to lift elements
6. **Increase contrast** between hierarchy levels
7. **Remove every element** that doesn't earn its place

---

## Phase 4: Validate (Test and Iterate)

### The Gut Check

- [ ] Would you put your name on this?
- [ ] What would a skilled designer call out?
- [ ] Does this feel like work that was cared about?

### The Tests

| Test                  | How                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Squint Test**       | Squint—does structure still read?                |
| **3-Second Test**     | Can someone get the point instantly?             |
| **Fresh Eyes Test**   | Look away, look back—what's off?                 |
| **Remove-One Test**   | Delete uncertain elements—do you miss them?      |

### When Testing with Users

- What worked well?
- What didn't work?
- What surprised us?
- What should we change?
- **Loop back to Phase 1 with new insights**

## Reference System

| Need                           | File                                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Pre-delivery quality check     | `references/interrogation-checklist.md`   |
| Specific visual techniques     | `references/technique-catalog.md`         |
| Inspiration & principles       | `references/reference-library.md`         |
| Systematic refinement          | `references/elevation-protocol.md`        |
| Balancing boldness/restraint   | `references/design-philosophy.md`         |

---

## Design Mindsets

Carry these throughout:

| Mindset | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Empathy** | Understand before solving |
| **Curiosity** | Ask "why" and "what if" |
| **Optimism** | Believe better solutions exist |
| **Experimentation** | Learn through trying |
| **Intentionality** | Every choice is a decision, not a default |
| **Restraint** | Remove until it breaks, then add one back |

---

## Output Behavior

| Mode | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Default** | Run the full process silently. Deliver polished work. Quality speaks. |
| **If asked** | Share design thinking, explain choices, reveal the process. |
| **On iteration** | Maintain coherence through changes. Loop back to appropriate phase. |

---

## The Core Tension (Always Balance)

**Expertise** → Make choices that demonstrate craft. Sweat details. Don't accept defaults.

**Restraint** → Don't over-design. Don't show off. Don't upstage content.

**The goal**: Confident simplicity—design that feels inevitable.
